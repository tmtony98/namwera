          <p>Most people can take a moment to reflect on themselves and think about who in their life they drew inspiration from. That
            childhood hero who we aspired to grow up to be, an activist whose words struck a chord, or even that friend we grew side
            by side with. There are people, no matter where we are in our lives, that inspire us in any number of ways.
            
            Kamala Jean was lucky enough to meet someone that inspired her at age 75. Chimemwe "Happy" Mussa, at the time, an
            early 20 year old, had the heart and goal that managed 
            to inspire a woman more than three times his age.</p>

  <div class="row d-flex flex-column justify-content-center align-items-center">

      <div class="happy-bottom-para">
        <p>That is the type of man that Happy is. One who's clear sense of ambition speaks for itself.
<br>
          Happy is a devoted son, sibling, and caretaker to the rest of his family. A brother, and leading figure to six
          siblings, Happy has made the decision to shoulder a load for himself and his family.
          <br>
          After his father passed away, he took it upon himself to earn money for the rest of his family through selling goods at a
          market in Cape Town. Unfortunately, this had taken him away from his family which he holds so dear.
          <br>
          This is where Kamala Jean met him. This is where Kamala Jean became inspired by a man that much younger than her.
          <br>
          His goal was to become a teacher. If he had had the chance to finish his grade 12 studies, then he would be able to move
          onto teachers college, and come away with a Certification, and a reliable source of income. It's a heartfelt goal, with
          nothing but the desire to support others lighting the fire in his heart.
          <br>
          Fast forward to 2021, and despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Happy is going through his final year of teachers col-
          lege. When he gets his hands on that Certification, the knowledge and abilities he acquired through years of hard work
          will be passed on to the young minds at the Gopie Community School.
          <br>
          But more than that, when he gets his hands on that Certification, all his efforts will have paid off in a more than tangible
          way.
          <br>
          Happy is a devoted young mind. Religious, family-oriented, and with a deep desire to support his community and future
          generations. It's no wonder that we're able to find inspiration in him.</p>
