        <p class="mb-5 mt-5 future-para">One of the greatest signs of success that the Namwera Project can point to is just how much the school has
          grown since
          its inception. It's been made clear that children want to learn, the determination in each of their hearts is
          apparent. Cre-
          ating a beacon of education that children want to flock towards is ultimately the goal, to promote a sustained
          desire to
          learn.

          With more children from the region signing up year after year, with more families, young men and women, all
          veering
          towards this pathway to education, the need for additional amenities has increased.

          Happy's desire to be a teacher, and to pay that work forward have been a huge addition to the cause. His
          determination and progress in teachers college are a sign of great things to come. But as class sizes continue
          to grow,
          the need for additional help in the classroom remains.</p>

        <p class="future-para">We at the Namwera Project have found a solution, a new innovation in classroom technology: the OneTab.

          The OneTab is a learning tablet designed to give its users a focused and interactive learning experience
          tailored to their level of progress and abilities. It's a pre-programmed device that will be able to teach
          kids in their
          native Chichewa as well as in English.
<br>
       <span class="mt-2">
        It teaches children numeracy, literacy, and even dabbles in expanding their knowledge of the world at large.
        Another
        incredible reason why we're looking towards the OneTab as the next step in promoting education in Malosa, is
        its abili-
        ty to teach kids about digital literacy.
       </span>  
<br>
<span class="mt-3">In an increasingly digitized world, knowing how to navigate new technologies, and having a basic
  understanding of how something like a touchscreen works, are incredibly valuable. Solving problems on a piece
  of
  hardware resembling something like an iPad goes a long way in making sure children are able to use that
  technology
  in the future. And more than that, it's even solar powered, with a push towards promoting sustainability at
  this local
  level.
<br></span>
          
          They've been used in Malawi before, helping other schools get off the ground, and help the teachers achieve
          their ed-
          ucational goals. It has allowed children to work themselves up to a point where the majority of the class is
          achieving at
          the same level.
<br>
          The OneTab is our hopeful next step in our work here in Namwera. We see these tablets as an incredible
          opportunity to not only help out our students, but help out our teachers too. Granting children and educators
          the
          access to new educational technology goes a long way towards securing the future for members of this
          community.</p>
