  <h1>The School</h1>
  <p> The Gopie Community School is the heart of the Namwera Project. Fostering and supporting the desire 
    to learn in young children has always been a tenet at the core of the Project. It's a school within 
    walking distance, a school that teaches whoever wishes to learn, and a school that has become a beacon 
    within the community. To grant all an equal opportunity, and to give future generations a better chance 
    at success. These are the hopes that the Gopie Community School laid its foundations upon.

      <p>Things have moved quickly here in Namwera. In only 4 years, the Gopie Community School has
        taken shape and children have flocked towards the opportunity to learn in this environment. From
        what started off as Happy's family home, has now become a centre that the community can rally
        around. With classrooms filled with children eager to learn, it's clear that this is only the beginning.
        Our vision for the school doesn't stop here. <br>
       <br>
        Solar panels have been built so that the village can have electricity. The skills centre is running
        strong, and has even supported the community by making masks to withstand the ongoing COVID-19
        pandemic. And the staff at the school continues to grow as demand from children in the area ramps
        up. The Gopie Community School is a symbol of determination for the people of Namwera, and is a
        sign that no matter the situation, people have a want to learn, all they need is the opportunity.</p>

        <h1> How You Can Help</h1>
        <p >We've made huge strides at the Namwera Project thanks to those who have supported us until now.
          But we're not done just yet. Our hopes for the Gopie Community School extend far beyond where
          we are now. Teaching children English as well as Chichewa, the two primary languages of Malawi, has
          been a key goal to make sure that these children have greater opportunities further down the road.
          As more children have enrolled in the school, tthe more resources will be needed. We hope to
          integrate interactive learning tablets into the process here at the school, not only to relieve some of
          the burden from our teachers, but to give children an increasingly interactive learning experience.</p>

  <p>The hands-on nature of learning tablets will allow children to have a more personalized experience,
    and will also teach children technological literacy in an increasingly tech-focused world!
    <br>
    So how can you help? We wouldn't be here without the help of all those that have supported us up
    to now. Namwera needs all the support we can give it. Through donations, through sharing the story
    of our school on social media, give this community the chance to share their story with the world.
    The Gopie Community school is our symbol of unity and teamwork, it is proof of how far we can go
    when we go as a team.</p>
