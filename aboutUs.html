          Kamala Jean Gopie is a retired elementary school teacher who taught in East York and
          North York. She was also an Educator Officer at the Ontario Ministry of Education. After
          retirement from education, she was appointed as a member of the Immigration and
          Refugee Board where for 8 years she made refugee determinations. She was
          subsequently appointed a part-time Ontario Human Rights Commissioner for two
          years. For over forty years she has been a volunteer working with community, arts,
          education, social service, health and funding organizations such as the Jamaican
          Canadian Association, Black Business and Professional Association, Roy Thomson Hall,
          Obsidian Theatre, Governing Council of the University of Toronto, and the United Way of
          Greater Toronto. Based on her community service she was awarded the Order of
          Ontario.</p>

<p class="p-3">Her current focus is a project she started in Malawi. A school has built in a village. Pre-
  school children, women and young men now have the opportunity to get an education.
  The women are learning to read and write English as well learn to sew and the young
  men who dropped out of school, are upgrading their skills and operate a maize mill as
  a way to earn an income. With recent flooding in Malawi, funds were sent to assist 28
  families who lost their homes, possession and crops.
  
  This project was brought to life because the families with young unschooled children
  in this part of Namwera, Malawi, needed a school which is within walking distance.
  This is a very poor under-served area of Malawi. There are no schools nearby for
  young children and where there is a primary school, many little girls are not encouraged
  or given the opportunity to attend.
  
  As a result of the Malawi Project in Namwera the children will have an opportunity to
  learn to read, write, and compute in Chichewa and English - the two official languages
  of Malawi.</p>
